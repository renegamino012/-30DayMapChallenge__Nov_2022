# #30DayMapChallenge, 2022
Data, code, and visualizations for 2022 #30DayMapChallenge. The collection of these assets can be found in the [personal website](https://renegamino012.github.io/projects/2022-30-day-map-challenge). 


## Day 05 (Color Friday: Green)
Ian Usher's [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ian-usher-16591b3b_30daymapchallenge-naturalengland-gis-activity-6994232031282888704-7bk2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) influenced this visualization, especially for their focus on the Access to Natural Greenspace Standards (ANGSt). However, I chose the City of Los Angeles as the location of interest because of its personal relevance.
